# Plan for [Main Goal]

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for achieving [Main Goal]. It details the phases, tasks, and context management strategies for working with AI agents to accomplish this objective.

## Task Status Legend

- [ ] To Do
- [x] Completed
- [‚è≥] In Progress
- [!] Blocked

## AI Agent Context Management

To maintain context and ensure effective collaboration with AI assistants throughout this project, we'll implement the following strategies:

### Memory Architecture

We'll use a multi-layered memory approach to maintain context:

1. **Session Memory**: Captures immediate context during development sessions.
2. **Task Memory**: Maintains summaries of completed work and decisions made.
3. **Project Knowledge Base**: Stores semantic understanding of code structures, patterns, and project-specific information.

### Smart Prompt Templates

When working with AI on specific tasks, use these standardized prompt structures:

#### Implementation Prompt Template

```text
I need to implement [feature/task] for [Project/Module Name].

Context:
- Current progress: [task status]
- Related files: [file paths]
- Design patterns/Guidelines: [patterns to follow or relevant guidelines]

Requirements:
- [Specific functionality needed]
- [Key considerations, e.g., security, performance]
- [UI/UX requirements, if applicable]

Please help me with: [specific assistance needed, e.g., code generation, a specific function, an algorithm]
```

#### Review Prompt Template

```text
Please review my implementation of [feature/component] for [Project/Module Name].

Context:
- Files changed: [file paths]
- Implementation approach: [brief description]
- Specific concerns: [any areas needing extra attention or questions you have]

Evaluation criteria:
- [Relevant standards, e.g., security, coding best practices]
- [Performance considerations]
- [Code quality metrics or style guides]
```

### Context Persistence

To maintain continuity across development sessions:

1. **Task Checkpoints**: Each task will include a "Last State" section that captures progress.
2. **Decision Log**: Important architectural, design, or strategic decisions will be documented.
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Insights from AI interactions (e.g., useful code snippets, explanations, alternative approaches) will be captured in task documentation or a shared knowledge base.

### Task Progress Tracking with Context

Tasks will include additional metadata to support continuity:

```text
Task: [Task Name]
Status: [Status]
Progress: [Percentage or Description]
Last Session Summary: [Brief recap of last work session related to this task]
Key Decisions: [Important choices made relevant to this task]
Next Steps: [Clear direction for continuation of this task]
Context References: [Related files, documents, previous discussions, or AI chat logs]

## AI Context Management Plan for [Main Goal] Project

To maximize AI assistance throughout this project, we'll implement the following context management approach:

### 1. Project Context Repository

- [ ] Create a `[Project_Ctx_Path]/context/base/` directory (or similar structured location) to store project context. Examples:
  - [ ] `architecture.md`: Overview of the project architecture or system design.
  - [ ] `security_model.md`: Documentation of security considerations, threats, and mitigations.
  - [ ] `component_map.md` or `module_interactions.md`: Diagram or description of how major parts relate.
  - [ ] `progress_log.md`: Ongoing development journal or decision log.
  - [ ] `data_models.md`: Definitions of key data structures and schemas.
  - [ ] `[domain]_best_practices.md`: Best practices relevant to the project's domain (e.g., `ux_best_practices_for_financial_tools.md`).
  - [ ] `style_guide.md`: Coding style, UI style, or language style guides.
  - [ ] `glossary.md`: Definitions of project-specific terms.

### 2. Task-Specific Context Files

- [ ] For each major feature or complex task, consider creating a context file or dedicated section within this document with:
  - [ ] Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria.
  - [ ] Design decisions, rationale, and alternatives considered.
  - [ ] Implementation challenges encountered and solutions found.
  - [ ] Testing approach, specific test cases, and results.
  - [ ] Key AI interactions, prompts used, and valuable outputs received.

### 3. AI Interaction Workflow

- [ ] Define standard AI interaction patterns for different types of work:
  - [ ] **Research prompts**: For gathering information on best practices, tools, or existing solutions.
  - [ ] **Design prompts**: For assistance in creating [component/module/data] structures, algorithms, or UI mockups.
  - [ ] **Implementation prompts**: For coding assistance, debugging, or refactoring.
  - [ ] **Review prompts**: For code review, documentation review, or design critique.
  - [ ] **Testing prompts**: For generating test cases, identifying edge cases, or suggesting testing strategies.
  - [ ] **Summarization prompts**: For summarizing long documents or chat histories to refresh context.

### 4. Context Refreshing Strategy

- [ ] Implement techniques to maintain context across sessions and interactions:
  - [ ] Start each new AI interaction or work session with a brief summary of the current goal and previous relevant work.
  - [ ] Reference specific context files or sections from this document for detailed history or information.
  - [ ] Use task checkpoints (as defined above) to track progress and provide focused context.
  - [ ] Document insights, decisions, and key outputs from AI interactions for future reference and to build the project knowledge base.
  - [ ] Periodically ask the AI to summarize its understanding of the task or project to ensure alignment.
