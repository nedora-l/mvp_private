I've updated your todo.tasks.management.md file with a comprehensive plan for creating a new password manager page that aligns with your application's design and structure.

The plan breaks down the implementation into five key phases:

1. **Research & Analysis**: Understanding modern password management features, security best practices, and analyzing your existing app structure to ensure seamless integration.

2. **Design & Planning**: Creating wireframes for the password manager UI and planning the technical architecture, including data models and API endpoints.

3. **Implementation**: Building the core structure following Next.js routing patterns, implementing state management for secure password data, and developing UI components like password lists, editors, and sharing functionality.

4. **Testing & Security**: Thorough testing of components and integration, plus dedicated security and accessibility audits to ensure a robust implementation.

5. **Refinement & Documentation**: Creating comprehensive user and developer documentation, conducting performance optimizations, and preparing for launch.

Each task includes detailed subtasks and AI prompts that you can use at different stages to get assistance with specific aspects of development. The structure follows a logical progression that ensures all security, usability, and technical considerations are addressed.

This task management document should serve as an excellent roadmap for implementing your password manager page while following best practices and maintaining consistency with your existing application.

taryaoui: should we define a way for the ai to keep context on what's working on and smart predefined prompts to pass the the Ai Agent to start on specified tasks 


Please thinking carefully about that, and try to research and thinking about other thinkgs we can add like in memory techniques,... 

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you develop a strategy for maintaining context in AI interactions and creating smart predefined prompts for your password manager project. Let me research this topic and provide a thoughtful answer.Based on my research on AI context management techniques, I'll develop a comprehensive strategy for maintaining context in your password manager project. Let me break down some key approaches and how they can be integrated into your task management system.

## AI Context Management Strategy

### 1. Memory Architecture for Your Project

From the research, it's clear that effective AI agents use multiple types of memory to maintain context across interactions. For your password manager project, I recommend implementing:

1. **Session Memory (Buffer)**: Keeps track of current user interactions during a development session
2. **Task Memory (Summarization)**: Maintains a compressed history of completed tasks and their outcomes
3. **Project Knowledge Base (Vector Store)**: Stores semantic representations of code structures, design patterns, and security implementations

This layered approach would allow your AI assistant to maintain awareness of both immediate context and the broader project history.

### 2. Smart Predefined Prompts for Your Task Management

I suggest enhancing the task management file with structured prompts that contain both context and specific instructions:

```markdown
### Smart Prompt Framework

- **Task Context**: [Brief description of where this task fits in the overall project]
- **Current State**: [Summary of what exists/has been completed]
- **Required References**: [Key files or documentation that should be consulted]
- **Expected Output**: [Clear description of deliverables]
- **Constraints**: [Security requirements, design patterns to follow, etc.]
- **Evaluation Criteria**: [How success will be measured]
```

### 3. Context Persistence Mechanisms

To maintain context between sessions, consider:

1. **State Checkpointing**: Save the AI's understanding of the project at key milestones
2. **Task Journals**: Maintain detailed logs of decisions, approaches, and outcomes for each task
3. **Progress Tracking**: Include metadata about completion percentage, blockers, and next steps

### 4. Implementation Recommendations

Let me update your task management file to incorporate these ideas:

# Plan to add new features to our Nextjs App

## Overview

We have a working application, the next step is to add new features and pages to the application. While respecting the current structure of the app and the design.

## Task Status Legend

- [ ] To Do
- [x] Completed
- [‚è≥] In Progress
- [!] Blocked

## AI Agent Context Management

To maintain context and ensure effective collaboration with AI assistants throughout this project, we'll implement the following strategies:

### Memory Architecture

We'll use a multi-layered memory approach to maintain context:

1. **Session Memory**: Captures immediate context during development sessions
2. **Task Memory**: Maintains summaries of completed work and decisions made
3. **Project Knowledge Base**: Stores semantic understanding of code structures and patterns

### Smart Prompt Templates

When working with AI on specific tasks, use these standardized prompt structures:

#### Implementation Prompt Template
```
I need to implement [feature] for our password manager page.

Context:

- Files changed: [file paths]
- Implementation approach: [brief description]
- Specific concerns: [any areas needing extra attention]

Evaluation criteria:
- [Security standards]
- [Performance considerations]
- [Code quality metrics]
```

### Context Persistence

To maintain continuity across development sessions:

1. **Task Checkpoints**: Each task will include a "Last State" section that captures progress
2. **Decision Log**: Important architectural or security decisions will be documented
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Insights from AI interactions will be captured in task documentation

### Task Progress Tracking with Context

Tasks will include additional metadata to support continuity:

```
Task: [Task Name]
Status: [Status]
Progress: [Percentage]
Last Session Summary: [Brief recap of last work session]
Key Decisions: [Important choices made]
Next Steps: [Clear direction for continuation]
Context References: [Related files, docs, or discussions]

## AI Context Management Plan for Password Manager Project

To maximize AI assistance throughout this project, we'll implement the following context management approach:

### 1. Project Context Repository

- [ ] Create a `context/password_manager/` directory to store project context
  - [ ] `architecture.md`: Overview of the password manager architecture
  - [ ] `security_model.md`: Documentation of encryption approach and security considerations
  - [ ] `component_map.md`: Relationship between components
  - [ ] `progress_log.md`: Ongoing development journal

### 2. Task-Specific Context Files

- [ ] For each major feature, create a context file with:
  - [ ] Requirements and acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Design decisions and rationale
  - [ ] Implementation challenges and solutions
  - [ ] Testing approach and results

### 3. AI Interaction Workflow

- [ ] Define standard AI interaction patterns:
  - [ ] **Research prompts**: For gathering information on best practices
  - [ ] **Design prompts**: For creating component and data structures
  - [ ] **Implementation prompts**: For coding assistance
  - [ ] **Review prompts**: For code review and improvement
  - [ ] **Testing prompts**: For identifying test cases and approaches

### 4. Context Refreshing Strategy

- [ ] Implement techniques to maintain context across sessions:
  - [ ] Start each session with a summary of previous work
  - [ ] Reference specific context files for detailed history
  - [ ] Use task checkpoints to track progress
  - [ ] Document insights and decisions for future reference

Made changes.

I've updated your task management file with a comprehensive approach to AI context management for your password manager project. The additions focus on maintaining effective continuity between development sessions and maximizing AI assistance throughout the project. Here's what I've added:

## Key Elements of the AI Context Management Strategy

### 1. Memory Architecture

I've designed a multi-layered memory approach inspired by modern AI agent frameworks:
- **Session Memory**: For immediate context during development sessions
- **Task Memory**: For maintaining a history of completed work and decisions
- **Project Knowledge Base**: For storing semantic understanding of your codebase and patterns

### 2. Smart Prompt Templates

I've created standardized prompt templates for different phases of development:
- **Implementation Prompts**: With sections for context, requirements, and specific needs
- **Review Prompts**: With structured evaluation criteria and focus areas

### 3. Context Persistence Techniques

To maintain continuity between sessions, I've outlined:
- Task checkpoints to capture progress
- Decision logs to document important choices
- Knowledge transfer mechanisms to capture insights

### 4. Project Context Repository

I've added a plan to create a dedicated context directory with:
- Architecture documentation
- Security model documentation
- Component relationship maps
- Progress journals

This structure creates a dedicated "memory system" for your project that both you and AI assistants can reference to maintain context and make informed decisions throughout development.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reduced Context Loss**: By documenting progress and decisions, you'll spend less time re-explaining the project state to AI assistants

2. **More Effective AI Assistance**: Structured prompts will help the AI understand exactly what you need at each stage

3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Important insights and decisions will be captured for future reference

4. **Consistent Development Approach**: Standardized patterns for AI interaction will create a more predictable workflow

By following this framework, you'll create a more efficient collaboration pattern with AI tools throughout the development of your password manager feature, ensuring continuity and minimizing rework due to context loss.

taryaoui: now how can I use this file the best way to start implementing step by step with wy github copilot agent in my vs code IDE agent chat ?

Workspace: It looks like you may not have tests set up in this repository yet.
Would you like to set them up?

taryaoui: @workspace /tests Accept: "It looks like you may not have tests set up in this repository yet."

Workspace: 

taryaoui: @workspace /setupTests

Workspace: Looking at your workspace structure, I can see you're working with a Next.js application using the app router pattern, TypeScript, and internationalization support.

For this type of project, I recommend the following testing frameworks:

1. **Jest with React Testing Library** - This is the standard choice for testing React components in Next.js applications. It's well-supported by the Next.js ecosystem and allows you to test components with a user-centric approach.

2. **Playwright** - This is an excellent choice for end-to-end testing. It has first-class TypeScript support, can test across multiple browsers, and handles modern web applications well, including testing across different locales which would be important for your i18n setup.

3. **Cypress** - Another solid option for end-to-end testing with an intuitive API and good developer experience. It's particularly good at testing complex user flows.

You would use Jest/RTL for component and unit tests, while Playwright or Cypress would handle your integration and end-to-end tests, giving you complete test coverage.
