# Slack Integration Research

## Executive Summary

Slack is a leading collaboration platform with a rich API ecosystem, enabling deep integration with enterprise tools, ESN, and intranet apps. Integrating Slack can enhance communication, automate workflows, and centralize notifications within our app.

## Slack Integration Overview

Slack offers two main integration paths:

- **App Directory Integrations:** Pre-built, one-way or simple two-way integrations (e.g., notifications).
- **Custom API Integrations:** Full access to Slack data and actions via APIs for advanced, bi-directional, and deeply customized workflows.

## All Possible Features

- Send/read messages in channels, DMs, and groups
- List, create, archive, and manage channels
- Fetch user and team info
- Post interactive content (buttons, forms)
- Listen to events (messages, reactions, user actions)
- Automate workflows (bots, reminders, triggers)
- File uploads and sharing
- Manage permissions and access
- Real-time messaging and notifications

## Best Features for Our ESN/INTRANET App

- **Channel and message overview:** Show recent messages, active channels, and unread counts inside our app
- **Centralized notifications:** Aggregate Slack alerts with other intranet notifications
- **Quick actions:** Post to Slack, reply, or create channels from our UI
- **User presence and status:** Display Slack status in user profiles
- **Workflow automation:** Trigger Slack actions from intranet events (e.g., new document, announcement)

## Slack Opportunities

- Improve cross-team communication
- Reduce context switching by surfacing Slack data in our app
- Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., reminders, approvals)
- Enhance onboarding and employee engagement
- Enable real-time support and feedback channels

## Slack Integration with Our App

### Technical Approach

- **Authentication:** Use Slack OAuth 2.0 for secure, user-granted access
- **APIs:**
  - `conversations.list` — List all channels
  - `conversations.history` — Fetch messages from a channel
  - `users.info` — Get user details
  - `chat.postMessage` — Send messages
- **Event Subscriptions:** Listen for new messages, reactions, or channel changes
- **Demo/Testing:**
  - Fetch and display a list of channels (names, members, topics)
  - Show recent messages from a selected channel
  - (Optional) Allow posting a test message from our app

#### Example: Fetching Channels and Messages

- Use `conversations.list` to get all channels (requires `channels:read` scope)
- Use `conversations.history` to get messages from a channel (requires `channels:history` scope)
- Authenticate via OAuth 2.0 and store access tokens securely

- [OAuth 2.0 Guide](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2)

## Next Steps

1. Register our app in Slack and configure OAuth scopes
2. Implement OAuth flow in our app
3. Build a simple UI to display Slack channels and messages for testing
4. Expand integration based on user feedback and business needs
