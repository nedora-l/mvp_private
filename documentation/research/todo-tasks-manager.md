          - Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for all API requests, responses, errors, and key internal operations (MCP connection attempts, routing decisions).
          - Include correlation IDs to trace requests across services.
          - Log MCP server interaction details: target server, tool called, request parameters (sensitive data masked), response status, latency.
          - Ensure log levels are configurable (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
          - **1. What to Log (Already Detailed)**
            - API Interactions (Request/Response)
            - Authentication & Authorization Events
            - MCP Client Internal Operations
            - MCP Server Interactions
            - Errors & Exceptions
          - **2. Log Structure:**
            - **Timestamp:** ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2025-05-18T10:30:00.123Z`).
            - **Level:** Log level (e.g., `INFO`, `ERROR`, `DEBUG`).
            - **Correlation ID:** Unique ID to trace a request through the system and across services.
            - **Source/Component:** Module or component generating the log (e.g., `MCPClientAPI`, `JiraConnector`, `AuthMiddleware`).
            - **Message:** Human-readable log message.
            - **Payload/Context:** Structured data relevant to the log entry (e.g., request details, error stack trace, MCP server response snippets).
              - `request_id`: Matches correlation ID.
              - `user_id`: If available and relevant.
              - `mcp_server_id`: Identifier for the target MCP server.
              - `mcp_tool_name`: Name of the tool invoked on the MCP server.
              - `duration_ms`: For operations like API calls or MCP interactions.
              - `error_code`: If applicable.
              - `stack_trace`: For exceptions.
          - **3. Sensitive Data Handling:**
            - **Masking/Redaction:** Automatically mask or redact sensitive information in logs (e.g., API keys, passwords, tokens, PII within request/response payloads).
            - **Configuration:** Define patterns for sensitive data to be masked. This should be configurable and regularly reviewed.
            - **Access Control:** Log access should be restricted to authorized personnel.
            - **Compliance:** Ensure logging practices comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
          - **4. Log Levels (Standard Practice):**
            - **DEBUG:** Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. Should be disabled in production by default.
            - **INFO:** Routine information, such as API calls, service startup/shutdown, significant lifecycle events.
            - **WARN:** Potentially harmful situations or unusual events that are not critical errors (e.g., deprecated API usage, high retry counts).
            - **ERROR:** Error events that might still allow the application to continue running (e.g., failed MCP server call, validation error).
            - **FATAL/CRITICAL:** Severe error events that will presumably lead to application termination.
          - **5. Correlation IDs:**
            - **Generation:** Generate a unique correlation ID at the entry point of the API (or use one provided by an upstream client/gateway like `X-Request-ID`).
            - **Propagation:** Propagate this ID through all internal service calls and to any external services (like MCP servers) if they support it (e.g., via HTTP headers).
            - **Logging:** Include the correlation ID in every log message related to that request. This allows for easy filtering and tracing of a single request's lifecycle across distributed components.

              - Basic API responsiveness (e.g., returns HTTP 200 OK).
              - Optional: Connectivity to critical downstream dependencies like a central configuration service or a primary database if applicable (avoid checking all MCP servers here to keep it fast).
            - **Response:** Simple JSON response indicating status (e.g., `{"status": "UP"}`).
          - **2. Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Integration:**
            - **Purpose:** Gain deep insights into API performance, trace requests, identify bottlenecks, and monitor errors in real-time.
            - **Integration:** Integrate with an existing or new APM solution (e.g., Prometheus with Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace, AWS CloudWatch APM, Azure Application Insights).
            - **Key Metrics to Track (via APM):**
              - Request Rate (Throughput)
              - Error Rates (HTTP 4xx, 5xx)
              - Latency (Average, p50, p90, p95, p99 for API responses and MCP server interactions)
              - CPU and Memory Utilization of the API service
              - Network I/O
              - MCP Server specific metrics (e.g., success/failure rates per server, latency per server).
            - **Distributed Tracing:** Ensure traces capture the full lifecycle of a request, including calls to MCP servers.
          - **3. Dashboarding:**

        - **Common Operations:** Task/subtask CRUD (assignments, due dates, comments, attachments), project/section management, workspace/team/user data, portfolio/goal management, custom fields.
        - **SDKs/Resources:** Official Asana developer portal (client libraries for Python, Node.js, Java, Ruby).
    - **CRM Platforms:**
      - **Salesforce:**
        - **API Type:** Suite of APIs (REST for data CRUD, SOAP, Bulk, Streaming for events, Metadata).
        - **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 (various flows: Web Server, JWT Bearer, User-Agent, Device Flow).
        - **Common Operations:** CRUD on standard/custom objects (Accounts, Contacts, etc.), SOQL queries, SOSL searches, metadata interaction.
        - **SDKs/Resources:** Salesforce Developers portal, official/community SDKs, SFDX CLI.
- [x] Research methods for dynamic routing of requests to different MCP servers based on configuration.
  - **Initial Research Summary (Dynamic Routing):**
    - **API Gateway Pattern:** This is a common and highly relevant pattern. An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests and can route them to various backend microservices (in our case, MCP server connectors).
      - **Key Features:** Request routing, composition, protocol translation, authentication, rate limiting, caching, monitoring.
      - **Routing Mechanisms:**
        - **Path-Based Routing:** Route based on the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/mcp/jira/...` routes to Jira connector, `/api/v1/mcp/slack/...` to Slack). This is a straightforward approach if server types are part of the API path.
        - **Header-Based Routing:** Route based on custom HTTP headers (e.g., `X-MCP-Target-Server: jira`). Useful if the primary endpoint is generic (e.g., `/api/v1/mcp/chat`).
        - **Parameter-Based Routing:** Route based on a query parameter or a field in the request body (e.g., `{"server": "jira", "tool_input": {...}}`). This aligns well with the planned API design where the AI specifies the target server.
        - **Content-Based Routing:** More advanced, inspects the message content/payload to make routing decisions. Could be useful if the AI's natural language request itself implies the target server, requiring some NLP preprocessing before routing.
    - **Configuration for Routing:**
      - **Routing Rules:** The API Gateway or routing logic needs a configurable set of rules that map request characteristics (path, header, parameter, content) to the appropriate MCP server connector.
      - **Service Discovery:** In a dynamic environment, the gateway might integrate with a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul, Eureka, Kubernetes services) to find available instances of MCP server connectors. For our initial scope, a simpler configuration-based mapping should suffice.
      - **Dynamic Configuration Updates:** Ideally, routing rules can be updated without restarting the API service (e.g., by reloading a configuration file or fetching rules from a config server).
    - **Implementation Options:**
      - **Existing API Gateway Solutions:**
        - **Cloud-native:** AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Google Cloud API Gateway. These offer managed services with rich features but might introduce external dependencies or costs.
        - **Self-hosted/Open Source:** Kong, Tyk, Apache APISIX, Spring Cloud Gateway (if Java-based), Express Gateway (if Node.js-based). These provide more control but require management.
      - **Custom Implementation (within our app):** For a focused MCP client, a lightweight custom routing logic within our Next.js API route handler might be sufficient initially. This would involve:
        - A module to load and parse MCP server configurations (including their unique identifiers).
        - A dispatcher function that inspects the incoming request (e.g., the `server` field in the JSON payload).
        - A map or switch-like structure to select the correct MCP server connector/handler based on the identified server.
        - This approach keeps the architecture simpler and avoids adding a new major component if the routing needs are not overly complex.
    - **Considerations for MCP Client:**
      - **Centralized vs. Decentralized Logic:** The API Gateway pattern centralizes routing.
      - **Flexibility:** The routing mechanism must be flexible enough to accommodate new MCP servers with minimal code changes, relying on configuration.
      - **Performance:** Routing should add minimal overhead to the request processing time.
      - **Error Handling:** How are routing failures (e.g., unknown server specified) handled and reported?
- [x] Investigate strategies for managing diverse authentication requirements for various MCP servers.
  - **Initial Research Summary (Diverse Authentication Management):**
    - **Challenge:** MCP servers will use various authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, API Keys, Basic Auth, custom token headers, etc.). The MCP Client API needs a flexible way to handle these without exposing complexity to the AI or requiring constant code changes for new auth types.
    - **Strategies & Patterns:**
      - **1. Centralized Authentication at the API Gateway/Client Level (for incoming AI requests):**
        - Our API already plans to use NextAuth.js to authenticate the AI agent itself. This is separate from authenticating *with* downstream MCP servers.
      - **2. Secure Credential Storage:**
        - **Vault/Secrets Manager:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager) to store sensitive credentials like API keys, OAuth client secrets, etc., for each configured MCP server.
        - **Environment Variables:** For simpler setups or during development, environment variables can be used, but they are less secure and harder to manage at scale.
        - **Configuration Encryption:** If storing credentials in a config file (not recommended for production secrets), the sensitive parts of the configuration should be encrypted.
      - **3. Abstraction Layer for Authentication:**
        - **Auth Strategy per MCP Server:** Define an authentication strategy or profile for each MCP server type or even instance in its configuration.
        - **Authenticator Components/Modules:** Create dedicated modules or classes (e.g., `OAuth2Handler`, `ApiKeyAuthHandler`, `BasicAuthHandler`) that encapsulate the logic for specific authentication flows.
        - **Dynamic Instantiation:** When a request needs to go to a specific MCP server, the MCP client dynamically selects and uses the appropriate authenticator component based on the server's configuration.
        - **Token Management & Caching:** For token-based auth (like OAuth 2.0), implement robust token fetching, caching (with respect to expiry times), and automatic refresh logic. This should be part of the authenticator component.
      - **4. API Gateway for Outbound Authentication (Offloading):**
        - Some advanced API Gateways can manage authentication to backend services. The gateway itself can be configured to inject API keys, handle OAuth token exchanges, etc., before forwarding the request.
        - This can simplify the MCP client's code but might tie the solution to a specific gateway product and its capabilities.
      - **5. Standardized Configuration for Authentication Parameters:**
        - Define a consistent way to specify authentication parameters in the MCP server configuration. For example:

          ```json
          {
            "server_id": "jira-prod",
            "type": "jira",
            "auth_type": "oauth2_client_credentials", // or "api_key", "basic_auth"
            "credentials_secret_id": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:jira-prod-creds-abcdef", // Pointer to vault
            // or inline for less sensitive, or dev:
            // "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
            // "token_url": "https://auth.example.com/token",
            // "client_id_secret_id": "client_id_value_from_vault"
            // "client_secret_secret_id": "client_secret_value_from_vault"
          }
          ```

    - **Considerations for MCP Client:**
      - **Security:** Prioritize secure storage and handling of all credentials. Avoid hardcoding secrets.
      - **Configuration Clarity:** Make it clear how to configure authentication for each MCP server.

### 1.3. Requirements Gathering

- [x] Detail specific requirements for AI interaction with the MCP Client API (e.g., expected request formats from AI, desired response structures for AI).
  - **AI Request Format:**
    - **Primary Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/mcp/chat` (as initially designed).
    - **Payload Structure (JSON):**

      ```json
      {
        "server_id": "string", // Unique identifier for the target MCP server instance (e.g., "jira-daws-project", "slack-general-channel")
        "tool_name": "string", // Specific tool/operation on the MCP server (e.g., "jira:create_issue", "slack:send_message", "web_search:search")
        "tool_input": { // Flexible object, structure depends on the 'tool_name'
          // Example for "jira:create_issue"
          // "project_key": "DAWS",
          // "summary": "New bug found",
          // "description": "Detailed description of the bug.",
          // "issue_type": "Bug",
          // "assignee_id": "user_id_or_email", // Optional
          // "labels": ["bug", "frontend"], // Optional
          // "priority": "High" // Optional
        },
        "conversation_context": { // Optional: For maintaining state or providing broader context if needed by the tool
          "thread_id": "string", // e.g., Slack thread ID
          "user_query_history": [ // Brief history if relevant for disambiguation or follow-up
            {"role": "user", "content": "Previous query"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Previous response"}
          ]
        },
        "request_id": "string" // Optional: Unique ID generated by AI for tracking
      }
      ```

    - **Headers:**
      - `Authorization`: `Bearer <next_auth_session_token>` (for authenticating the AI/user to our API).
      - `Content-Type`: `application/json`.
  - **API Response Structure for AI:**
    - **Success Response (HTTP 200 OK):**

      ```json
      {
        "status": "success",
        "server_id": "string", // Echo back the server_id
        "tool_name": "string", // Echo back the tool_name
        "tool_output": { // Flexible object, structure depends on the 'tool_name' and MCP server response
          // Example for "jira:create_issue"
          // "issue_key": "DAWS-123",
          // "issue_url": "https://your-jira.atlassian.net/browse/DAWS-123",
          // "summary": "New bug found"
        },
        "message": "string | null", // Optional: Human-readable success message or summary
        "original_request_id": "string | null" // Echo back if provided by AI
      }
      ```

    - **Error Response (HTTP 4xx/5xx):**

      ```json
      {
        "status": "error",
        "server_id": "string | null", // If identifiable
        "tool_name": "string | null", // If identifiable
        "error": {
          "type": "string", // e.g., "Validation Error", "MCP Server Error", "Authentication Error", "API Internal Error", "Tool Not Found"
          "message": "string", // Detailed error message for AI/developer
          "details": "string | object | null", // Additional details, could be structured error from MCP server or validation issues
          "mcp_server_status_code": "integer | null", // If error originated from MCP server, its HTTP status code
          "mcp_server_error_details": "object | string | null" // Raw or processed error from MCP server
        },
        "original_request_id": "string | null" // Echo back if provided by AI
      }
      ```

  - **Key AI Interaction Principles:**
    - **Statelessness:** API calls should be stateless by default. If session/state management is needed for a specific tool, it should be handled explicitly via `conversation_context` or managed by the MCP connector.
    - **Clarity:** Responses, especially errors, must be clear and provide enough information for the AI to understand the issue and potentially retry or guide the user.
    - **Consistency:** While `tool_input` and `tool_output` are flexible, the overall request/response structure should be consistent.
    - **Discoverability (Future):** Consider an endpoint for the AI to query available `server_id`s and their supported `tool_name`s with expected `tool_input` schemas.
- [x] Specify configuration requirements for adding, removing, and managing MCP servers (e.g., credentials, API keys, server-specific parameters).
  - **Configuration Storage:**
    - **Primary Method:** Secure secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault). Each MCP server instance configuration will be a distinct secret.
    - **Alternative (Development/Testing):** Environment variables or a local, git-ignored JSON/YAML configuration file. Sensitive values in local files should still be placeholders or use a dev-specific, non-production secret store if possible.
  - **Configuration Structure (per MCP Server Instance):**
    A JSON object stored as a secret, containing:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "string", // Unique, human-readable identifier for this server config (e.g., "jira-daws-project-prod") - This will be the `server_id` used by AI.
      "type": "string", // Type of MCP server (e.g., "jira", "slack", "salesforce", "custom_api"). Used to select the correct connector.
      "name": "string", // User-friendly display name (e.g., "Jira (DAWS Project - Production)")
      "enabled": "boolean", // Whether this configuration is active.
      "auth_details": {
        "method": "string", // e.g., "oauth2_client_credentials", "api_key", "basic_auth", "bearer_token"
        // Fields below depend on the 'method'
        // Example for api_key:
        // "api_key_secret_name": "string", // Name of the secret in the vault holding the actual API key
        // "header_name": "string", // e.g., "X-API-Key" (if applicable)
        // "query_param_name": "string" // (if applicable)
        // Example for oauth2_client_credentials:
        // "token_url": "string",
        // "client_id_secret_name": "string",
        // "client_secret_secret_name": "string",
        // "scopes": ["scope1", "scope2"] // Optional
      },
      "base_url": "string", // Base API URL for the MCP server (e.g., "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3")
      "rate_limits": { // Optional: Override default rate limits for this specific server if needed
        "requests_per_second": "number",
        "burst_limit": "number"
      },
      "default_tool_config": { // Optional: Default parameters for tools on this server
        // "jira:create_issue": { "default_project_key": "DAWS" }
      },
      "custom_parameters": { // Any other server-specific parameters needed by the connector
        // "slack_default_channel_id": "C12345678"
      },
      "metadata": { // Optional: For UI display or additional context
        "description": "string",
        "icon_url": "string"
      }
    }
    ```

  - **Management Operations:**
    - **Adding a new MCP Server:**
      - Create a new secret in the vault with the above structure.
      - The MCP Client API should detect new configurations (e.g., by periodic refresh from the vault or a trigger mechanism if available).
    - **Updating an MCP Server Configuration:**
      - Update the corresponding secret in the vault.
      - The MCP Client API should pick up changes. Consider cache invalidation strategies for configurations.
    - **Removing an MCP Server:**
      - Mark `enabled: false` in the secret for a soft delete.
      - Or, delete the secret from the vault for a hard delete. The API should handle missing configurations gracefully.
    - **Listing MCP Servers:** An administrative endpoint might be needed to list currently loaded and active MCP server configurations (excluding sensitive details).
  - **Security:**
    - Access to the secrets management system must be tightly controlled.
    - The MCP Client API service role/identity needs read-only access to the relevant secrets.
    - Avoid logging sensitive configuration values.
- [x] Define comprehensive error handling and logging requirements for the API, including how errors from underlying MCP servers are propagated.
  - **Error Categories & Handling:**
    - **1. API Input Validation Errors (HTTP 400 Bad Request):**
      - **Trigger:** Malformed JSON, missing required fields in AI request (`server_id`, `tool_name`), invalid data types.
      - **Response:** Standardized error response with `type: "Validation Error"`, `message` indicating the issue, and `details` object showing specific field errors.
      - **Logging:** Log the error, correlation ID, and sanitized request payload.
    - **2. Authentication/Authorization Errors (HTTP 401 Unauthorized / HTTP 403 Forbidden):**
      - **Trigger:** Invalid or missing NextAuth.js token for API access. (Future: User not authorized to use a specific MCP server or tool).
      - **Response:** Standard HTTP 401/403 response. Error payload with `type: "Authentication Error"` or `type: "Authorization Error"`.
    - **3. MCP Server Connection Errors (HTTP 502 Bad Gateway, HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout):**
      - **Trigger:** Failure to connect to the configured MCP server (network issues, server down, etc.).
      - **Response:** Standardized error response with `type: "MCP Server Connection Error"`, `message` with details.
      - **Logging:** Log the error with details about the MCP server and the original request.
    - **4. MCP Server Response Errors (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, HTTP 404 Not Found, etc.):**
      - **Trigger:** Invalid or unexpected response from the MCP server.
      - **Response:** Standardized error response with `type: "MCP Server Error"`, `message` detailing the issue, `mcp_server_status_code` for the original response code.
      - **Logging:** Log the error, original MCP server response, and request details.
    - **5. Rate Limiting Errors (HTTP 429 Too Many Requests):**
      - **Trigger:** Exceeding the rate limit for the MCP server or the API itself.
      - **Response:** Standard HTTP 429 response. Error payload with `type: "Rate Limit Exceeded"`, `message` indicating the limit and retry time.
      - **Logging:** Log the occurrence of rate limiting, including the affected MCP server and request details.
    - **6. Unexpected Errors (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error):**
      - **Trigger:** Any other unhandled exceptions or errors within the API.
      - **Response:** Generic error response with `type: "Internal Server Error"`, `message` indicating an unexpected error occurred.
      - **Logging:** Log the full error details, stack trace, and request context for diagnosis.
    - **Audit Trail:** Log successful and failed attempts to add/update/remove MCP server configurations (administrative actions).
- [x] Gather requirements for API versioning and lifecycle management.
  - **API Versioning Strategy:**
    - **URI Versioning:** Include the version in the API path (e.g., `/api/v1/mcp/...`). This is the simplest and most common approach.
    - **Header Versioning:** Clients specify the desired version in the request header (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`). This allows for more flexibility and cleaner URIs.
    - **Version Negotiation:** The server can respond with the available versions and let the client choose, or the server can automatically route to the latest version.
  - **Deprecation Policy:**
    - Clearly communicate deprecation timelines and support for older versions.
    - Provide a migration path and support for clients to transition to newer API versions.
  - **Backward Compatibility:** Strive to maintain backward compatibility within the same major version to avoid breaking changes for clients.
  - **Documentation:** Keep comprehensive and versioned documentation for each API version.

## Phase 2: Design & Architecture

### 2.1. API Design

- [x] Define the API endpoint structure and request/response formats for MCP interactions.
  - **Details:**
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/mcp/chat` (Confirmed from Phase 1.3 requirements).
    - **Request (AI to API):** (Based on Phase 1.3, section "AI Request Format")
      - **Content Type:** `application/json`.
      - **Key fields:** `server_id` (identifies configured MCP instance), `tool_name` (specific function on the server), `tool_input` (parameters for the tool), `conversation_context` (optional, for conversational AI), `user_preferences` (optional, for user-specific settings).
    - **Response (API to AI):** (Based on Phase 1.3, section "API Response Structure for AI")
      - **Content Type:** `application/json`.
      - **Success:** Includes `status: "success"`, `server_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_output` (results from MCP server), and `original_request`.
      - **Error:** Includes `status: "error"`, `server_id` (if applicable), `tool_name` (if applicable), and an `error` object with `code`, `message`, `details` (optional), and `original_request`. The error message should be AI-consumable.
    - **Authentication (for the API endpoint itself):** The API endpoint will be secured using NextAuth.js. The AI agent (client) will need to present a valid session token (e.g., JWT Bearer token) in the `Authorization` header with each request.
- [ ] Design the configuration schema for MCP servers.
  - **Details:**
    - **Storage:** Configuration will be stored securely, likely using environment variables for sensitive parts or a dedicated configuration management system/vault for production. For local development, a JSON or YAML file structure can be defined.
    - **Schema Structure (Conceptual):** An array of MCP server configurations. Each object in the array will represent a configurable MCP server instance.

      ```json
      [
        {
          "id": "unique-server-instance-001", // Unique identifier for this specific server configuration
          "name": "Jira Default Project", // User-friendly name for this instance
          "type": "jira", // Predefined type (e.g., "jira", "slack", "web_search", "asana", "salesforce")
          "isEnabled": true, // Allows enabling/disabling this server instance
          "authentication": {
            "method": "oauth2", // e.g., "oauth2", "api_key", "basic_auth", "pat" (Personal Access Token)
            // Fields below depend on the method
            // Example for OAuth 2.0 (credentials often stored in a vault, referenced here by key)
            "clientIdRef": "JIRA_CLIENT_ID_VAULT_KEY",
            "clientSecretRef": "JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET_VAULT_KEY",
            "tokenUrl": "https://auth.atlassian.com/oauth/token",
            "scopes": ["read:jira-work", "write:jira-work"],
            // Access/Refresh tokens might be managed dynamically by the application
            "accessTokenRef": "JIRA_ACCESS_TOKEN_VAULT_KEY", // Or managed by the system
            "refreshTokenRef": "JIRA_REFRESH_TOKEN_VAULT_KEY" // Or managed by the system
          },
          "server_specific_config": {
            // Parameters specific to this server type
            // Example for Jira
            "instanceUrl": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
            "apiVersion": "2", // Optional, if the server supports versioning
            // Example for Slack
            // "botTokenRef": "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_VAULT_KEY",
            // "defaultChannelId": "C1234567890"
          },
          "tool_mapping": {
            // Optional: Mapping generic AI tool names to server-specific functions/endpoints if needed
            // "search_items": "jqlSearch",
            // "create_ticket": "createIssue"
          },
          "retry_policy": { // Optional: Override global retry policy
            "max_attempts": 3,
            "backoff_ms": 1000
          },
          "rate_limits": { // Optional: Information about known rate limits to respect
             "requests_per_minute": 60
          }
        }
        // ... more server configurations
      ]
      ```

    - **Key Considerations:**
      - **Secrets Management:** All sensitive values (API keys, secrets, tokens) must be stored securely (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) and referenced by keys in the configuration.
      - **Dynamic Reloading:** Explore mechanisms for updating configurations without requiring an API restart, if feasible and necessary.
      - **Validation:** Implement robust validation for the configuration schema on API startup.
- [ ] Specify how the API will handle different versions of MCP server APIs.
  - **Details:**
    - **Configuration-Driven:** The primary approach will be to specify the target API version within the `server_specific_config` section for each MCP server instance if the server supports explicit versioning (e.g., `"apiVersion": "v3"`).
    - **Connector Responsibility:** Each MCP server connector (the module responsible for interacting with a specific type of MCP server) will be designed to:
      - Target the configured API version.
      - Be aware of breaking changes between versions it might support (if a single connector handles multiple versions, though dedicated connectors per major version might be simpler).
    - **Default Version:** If a version is not specified in the configuration, the connector will use a predefined default version (preferably the latest stable version recommended by the MCP server provider).
    - **Path/Header Versioning:** For MCP servers that use URL path (e.g., `/api/v2/...`) or header-based versioning, the connector will construct requests accordingly based on the configured version.
    - **Error Handling for Version Mismatches:** The API should gracefully handle errors that arise from version incompatibilities (e.g., endpoint not found, deprecated feature) and provide a clear error message to the AI, potentially suggesting a configuration update.
    - **No Dynamic Probing (Initially):** Avoid dynamic probing of available API versions at runtime to keep initial complexity low. This can be a future enhancement if required.
    - **Documentation:** Clearly document which versions of MCP server APIs are supported by each connector.
- [ ] Define data transformation and mapping strategies between the AI's generic requests and server-specific formats.
  - **Details:**
    - **Connector-Centric Logic:** The core responsibility for data transformation and mapping lies within each individual MCP server connector.
    - **Input Transformation:** The connector for `server_X` will take the generic `tool_input` (JSON object) provided by the AI and transform it into the specific request format (e.g., query parameters, request body structure, headers) required by `server_X`'s API for the specified `tool_name`.
      - Example: AI `tool_input: { "query": "active tasks for project Y", "assignee": "currentUser" }` for Jira might be transformed into a JQL string `project = Y AND status = 'In Progress' AND assignee = currentUser()`.
    - **Output Transformation:** Conversely, the connector will transform the response received from `server_X`'s API into the generic `tool_output` JSON structure expected by the AI. This includes normalizing data structures and extracting relevant information.
      - Example: A complex Jira issue object might be simplified to include only key fields relevant to the AI's task.
    - **Internal Schemas/Templates:** Connectors may use internal schemas (e.g., using libraries like Zod for validation and typing) or mapping templates to define and manage these transformations.
    - **Transformation Libraries:** Utilize appropriate libraries for efficient and safe data manipulation (e.g., JSON processing, object mapping utilities).
    - **Error Handling in Transformation:** If transformation fails (e.g., AI provides invalid input that cannot be mapped), the connector should generate a specific error that can be relayed to the AI.
    - **Extensibility:** Design connectors such that updating transformation logic (e.g., due to an MCP server API update) is localized to that connector and relatively straightforward.
    - **No Universal Mapping Language (Initially):** Transformations will be implemented in code (e.g., TypeScript/JavaScript) within each connector.
- [ ] Outline the API's error handling strategy in detail (building on requirements from Phase 1.3).
  - **Details:**
    - **Standardized Error Response:** Adhere to the error response structure defined in Phase 1.3 ( `status: \"error\"`, `server_id`, `tool_name`, `error: { code, message, details }`, `original_request`).
    - **Error Categorization & Codes:** Define a clear set of internal error codes to distinguish between different types of failures. Examples:
      - `API_INTERNAL_ERROR`: General server-side issue within the MCP Client API.
      - `CONFIGURATION_ERROR`: Issue with an MCP server's configuration (e.g., missing credentials, invalid parameters).
      - `ROUTING_ERROR`: Failed to route request to the appropriate MCP server connector (e.g., unknown `server_id`).
      - `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE_API`: AI agent authentication to the MCP Client API failed.
      - `MCP_CONNECTION_ERROR`: Network or connectivity issue when trying to reach the MCP server.
      - `MCP_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE`: Authentication with the target MCP server failed (e.g., invalid API key, expired OAuth token).
      - `MCP_SERVER_ERROR`: The MCP server returned an error (5xx).
      - `MCP_CLIENT_ERROR`: The MCP server indicated a client-side error with the request sent by the connector (4xx, e.g., bad request, not found, forbidden).
      - `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: Request blocked due to rate limiting by the MCP server.
      - `DATA_TRANSFORMATION_ERROR`: Error during transformation of AI input to MCP format, or MCP response to AI format.
      - `TOOL_NOT_SUPPORTED`: The specified `tool_name` is not supported for the given `server_id`.
    - **Error Propagation & Sanitization:**
      - Errors from MCP servers should be caught by the respective connectors.
      - Connectors should translate these errors into the standardized API error response, providing a meaningful `message` for the AI and an appropriate `code`.
      - Avoid leaking sensitive information (stack traces, raw error messages from MCP servers that might contain internal details) directly to the AI. Sanitize and map to the defined error structure.
    - **Logging:** All errors must be logged comprehensively with:
      - A unique request ID for tracing.
      - Timestamp.
      - `server_id` and `tool_name` involved.
      - The generated error code and message.
      - Sanitized details of the original error from the MCP server or internal component.
      - Relevant parts of the AI's request.
    - **Retry Mechanisms:**
      - Implement a configurable retry strategy for transient errors (e.g., `MCP_CONNECTION_ERROR`, `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, some `MCP_SERVER_ERROR`s like 503).
      - Use exponential backoff with jitter.
      - Configure maximum retry attempts and backoff parameters globally and allow overrides per MCP server configuration.
    - **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
      - Implement a circuit breaker for each MCP server connector.
      - If a connector experiences a high rate of failures for a specific MCP server, the circuit breaker will \"open,\" causing subsequent requests to that server to fail fast without attempting connection.
      - This prevents the API from overwhelming a struggling MCP server and avoids tying up API resources.
      - The circuit breaker should have a defined timeout after which it transitions to a \"half-open\" state to test connectivity before fully closing again.
    - **AI-Consumable Error Messages:** Error messages returned to the AI should be clear, concise, and, where possible, suggest corrective actions (e.g., \"Authentication with Jira failed. Please ensure the Jira connection is configured correctly with valid credentials.\", \"The requested JQL query was invalid. Please check the syntax.\").

### 2.2. System Architecture

- [ ] **Develop a High-Level Architecture Diagram.**
  - **Details:**
    - Create a visual representation (e.g., using a tool like diagrams.net/draw.io, Mermaid JS, or even a clear textual description if a visual tool isn't immediately feasible for the markdown).
    - Key components to include:
      - AI Agent (External Client)
      - MCP Client API (This System)
        - API Gateway / Entry Point (e.g., Next.js API Route)
        - Authentication Layer (NextAuth.js)
        - Request Router/Dispatcher
        - Configuration Manager
      - MCP Server Connectors (Individual modules for Slack, Jira, WebSearch, etc.)
      - MCP Server Abstraction Layer (Interface for connectors)
      - Secure Configuration Store (e.g., Vault, Environment Variables)
      - Logging System
      - Monitoring System (Optional, but good to consider)
      - External MCP Servers (Slack, Jira, WebSearch APIs)
    - Show primary interaction flows between these components.
- [ ] **Define Component Breakdown and Responsibilities.**
  - **Details:**
    - **AI Agent:** (External) Initiates requests to the MCP Client API.
    - **MCP Client API (Core System):**
      - **API Entry Point (e.g., Next.js API Route `pages/api/v1/mcp/chat.ts`):** Receives HTTP requests, handles initial validation.
      - **Authentication Layer (NextAuth.js):** Verifies the AI Agent's identity and authorization.
      - **Request Router/Dispatcher:** Based on `server_id` in the request, routes the request to the appropriate MCP Server Connector.
      - **Configuration Manager:** Loads and provides access to MCP server configurations (including credentials, endpoints, specific settings). Manages secure retrieval of secrets.
      - **MCP Server Abstraction Layer/Interface:** Defines a common interface that all MCP Server Connectors must implement. This ensures consistency in how the core API interacts with different connectors.
        - Methods like `executeTool(toolName, toolInput, config, context)` could be part of this interface.
    - **MCP Server Connectors (e.g., `slackConnector.ts`, `jiraConnector.ts`):**
      - One connector per MCP server type (or per specific instance if significantly different).
      - Implements the MCP Server Abstraction Layer interface.
      - Handles specific authentication mechanism for its target MCP server (OAuth, API Key, etc.).
      - Manages API versioning for its target MCP server.
      - Transforms generic AI request data (`tool_input`) into the server-specific API request format.
      - Makes the actual API call to the external MCP server.
      - Transforms the server-specific response back into the generic AI response format (`tool_output`).
      - Implements server-specific error handling, mapping errors to the standard API error format.
      - Implements retry logic and circuit breaker patterns for its specific MCP server.
    - **Secure Configuration Store:**
      - Stores MCP server connection details, credentials, and other settings.
      - Employs mechanisms like environment variables, a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
    - **Logging System:**
      - Centralized logging for requests, responses, errors, and significant events.
      - Integration with a logging platform (e.g., Sentry, Datadog, ELK stack, or console logging for development).
    - **Monitoring System (Optional but Recommended):**
      - Tracks API performance (latency, error rates), resource usage, and health of MCP server connections.
      - Tools like Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog APM.
- [ ] **Specify the Technology Stack.**
  - **Details:**
    - **Programming Language:** TypeScript (as inferred from existing file paths like `api-client.ts`).
    - **Framework:** Next.js (for API routes and potentially admin UI if needed later).
    - **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (for securing the MCP Client API endpoint).
    - **HTTP Client:** A robust HTTP client library for making requests to MCP servers (e.g., `axios`, `node-fetch`, or the built-in `fetch` in Node.js >=18).
    - **Configuration Management:**
      - Environment variables (`dotenv` for local development).
      - Potentially a library for schema validation of configurations (e.g., `zod`).
      - Integration with a secrets manager for production.
    - **Logging:** A logging library (e.g., `pino`, `winston`) or standard console logging enhanced with structure.
    - **Testing:** Jest, Vitest, or similar for unit and integration tests.
    - **Data Validation/Transformation:** Libraries like `zod` for schema definition and validation of requests/responses and configurations.
    - **Circuit Breaker:** A library like `opossum` or a custom implementation.
    - **Development Environment:** Node.js, npm/yarn.
    - **Version Control:** Git.
- [ ] **Describe Data Flow for a Typical Request.**
  - **Details:**
    1. AI Agent sends a `POST` request to `/api/v1/mcp/chat` with a valid auth token and JSON payload (`server_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, etc.).
    2. Next.js API route receives the request.
    3. NextAuth.js middleware authenticates the AI Agent. If authentication fails, a 401/403 error is returned.
    4. The API handler validates the basic request structure.
    5. The Configuration Manager retrieves the configuration for the specified `server_id`. If not found or invalid, an error is returned.
    6. The Request Router/Dispatcher selects the appropriate MCP Server Connector based on the `server_id` (or `type` from configuration).
    7. The selected Connector\'s `executeTool` method (or similar) is called:
        a. Connector handles authentication with the target MCP server (e.g., retrieves/refreshes OAuth token using stored credentials).
        b. Connector transforms the generic `tool_input` into the MCP server\'s specific request format, considering the `tool_name` and configured API version.
        c. Connector makes the HTTP(S) call to the MCP server\'s API endpoint.
        d. Handles retries and circuit breaker logic if the call fails or times out.
        e. Upon receiving a response, the Connector transforms the MCP server\'s response into the generic `tool_output` format.
        f. If the MCP server returns an error, the Connector maps it to the standard API error format.
    8. The MCP Client API handler constructs the final JSON response (success or error) and sends it back to the AI Agent.
    9. All relevant steps, especially errors, are logged.
- [ ] **Define Extensibility for Adding New MCP Servers.**
  - **Details:**
    - **Standardized Connector Interface:** The core of extensibility is the MCP Server Abstraction Layer/Interface. To add a new MCP server type:
      1. Develop a new Connector class/module that implements this interface.
      2. Implement the server-specific logic within this new connector: authentication, data transformation, API calls, error handling.
      3. Add a new `type` identifier for this server (e.g, `\"my_new_service\"`) to be used in the configuration.
      4. Update the Request Router/Dispatcher to recognize the new `type` and map it to the new connector.
      5. Add configuration schema details and validation for the new server type.
    - **Dynamic Connector Loading (Optional Advanced):** For very dynamic environments, explore loading connectors based on configuration without code changes to the router, but this adds complexity.
    - **Clear Documentation:** Provide clear developer documentation on how to create and integrate a new connector.
    - **Configuration-Driven:** Adding a *new instance* of an *existing type* of MCP server (e.g., another Jira instance) should only require adding a new entry to the configuration file/store, not code changes.
- [ ] **Outline High-Level Deployment Strategy.**
  - **Details:**
    - **Initial Thoughts (to be refined in later phases):**
      - **Serverless Functions:** Platforms like Vercel (natural for Next.js), AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions are good candidates for deploying the API endpoints. This offers scalability and pay-per-use benefits.
      - **Containerization:** Alternatively, package the application as a Docker container and deploy it to services like AWS ECS/EKS, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or a simple container hosting service.
      - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) for automated testing, building, and deployment.
      - **Environment Management:** Separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments. Securely manage environment-specific variables and secrets.

### 2.3. Security Design

- [ ] **Define Authentication and Authorization for the MCP Client API itself.**
  - **Details:**
    - **Authentication Method:** NextAuth.js will be used to secure the `/api/v1/mcp/chat` endpoint.
    - **Strategy:** Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT Bearer tokens).
    - **Token Issuance:** The AI Agent (or the system it runs on) will need to authenticate with a NextAuth.js provider (e.g., Credentials provider for service accounts, or an OAuth provider if AI acts on behalf of a user) to obtain a session token.
    - **Token Validation:** On each API request, NextAuth.js will validate the token. Invalid or expired tokens will result in a 401 Unauthorized error.
    - **Authorization (Initial Scope):** Initially, any authenticated AI agent with a valid token is authorized to use the API. Finer-grained authorization (e.g., restricting which MCP servers an agent can use) can be added later if needed.
    - **Secure Token Handling:** Emphasize secure storage and transmission of tokens by the AI agent.
- [ ] **Detail Secure Handling of MCP Server Credentials.**
  - **Details:**
    - **Centralized Secrets Management:** Strongly recommend using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Doppler) for storing all MCP server API keys, OAuth client secrets, tokens, etc.
    - **Configuration References:** The MCP server configuration (Phase 2.1) will store *references* to these secrets (e.g., `JIRA_CLIENT_ID_VAULT_KEY`), not the secrets themselves.
    - **Runtime Retrieval:** The Configuration Manager component will be responsible for securely fetching these secrets from the vault at runtime when an MCP server connector needs them.
    - **Restricted Access:** Access to the secrets manager should be tightly controlled and audited.
    - **Environment Variables (Development/Fallback):** For local development or simpler setups where a full vault is overkill, environment variables can be used. Ensure these are not committed to version control (use `.env` files and `.gitignore`).
    - **Encryption at Rest:** If storing configuration files that might indirectly contain sensitive pointers, ensure the storage medium supports encryption at rest.
    - **In-Memory Handling:** Minimize the time credentials are held in memory. Clear them once used if possible.
    - **No Hardcoding:** Absolutely no hardcoding of credentials in source code.
- [ ] **Specify Input Validation and Sanitization.**
  - **Details:**
    - **API Request Validation:** Validate the structure and data types of incoming JSON payloads from the AI agent against a defined schema (e.g., using `zod`). This includes `server_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`.
      - Check for presence of required fields.
      - Validate data types (string, number, boolean, object, array).
      - Enforce length limits or specific formats where applicable (e.g., `server_id` pattern).
    - **`tool_input` Validation:** While `tool_input` is largely generic, basic validation (e.g., ensuring it's a valid JSON object) should be performed by the API. Deeper validation of `tool_input` structure specific to a tool is the responsibility of the respective MCP server connector.
    - **Output Sanitization (from MCP Servers):** Before returning data from an MCP server to the AI, connectors should sanitize it to prevent injection attacks if the AI might render this data in a web context or use it in further sensitive operations. This primarily involves ensuring that any strings are properly encoded or stripped of malicious characters if they are not expected to contain markup.
    - **Preventing Injection Attacks:** Be mindful of how `tool_input` is used by connectors when constructing requests to MCP servers (e.g., ensure proper escaping if constructing JQL, SQL-like queries, or shell commands, though direct shell command execution from AI input is highly discouraged).
    - **Error Messages:** Ensure error messages returned to the AI do not leak sensitive system information or internal stack traces.
- [ ] **Outline Measures Against Common API Vulnerabilities (OWASP API Security Top 10).**
  - **Details:**
    - **API1: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA):**
      - **Mitigation:** While initial scope is broad, future enhancements might require checking if the authenticated AI agent is permitted to access/use the specific `server_id` or `tool_name` requested. Currently relies on API-level auth via NextAuth.js.
    - **API2: Broken Authentication:**
      - **Mitigation:** Use NextAuth.js with strong authentication protocols. Secure token handling. Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts. Short-lived tokens with refresh mechanisms.
    - **API3: Broken Object Property Level Authorization:**
      - **Mitigation:** Connectors should only return data properties that the AI is intended to see. Avoid overly verbose responses from MCP servers being passed through directly. Filter/map to essential fields.
    - **API4: Unrestricted Resource Consumption:**
      - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on the MCP Client API. Circuit breakers for MCP server connectors. Timeouts for requests to MCP servers. Input validation to prevent overly large requests (e.g., limits on payload size).
    - **API5: Broken Function Level Authorization:**
      - **Mitigation:** Similar to API1. Ensure the routing logic correctly maps to connectors and that connectors only expose intended `tool_name` functionalities. Future: Role-based access to specific tools/servers.
    - **API6: Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows:**
      - **Mitigation:** Not directly applicable for this API as a proxy, but ensure that tools exposed don't inadvertently create high-risk composite flows without proper checks. Each tool call is discrete.
    - **API7: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
      - **Mitigation:** Connectors make requests to pre-configured MCP server URLs. Do not allow AI to specify arbitrary URLs for MCP server connections. Validate and sanitize any part of the `tool_input` that might be used in constructing a URL or request to an external service.
    - **API8: Security Misconfiguration:**
      - **Mitigation:** Secure default configurations. Regular security audits. Keep dependencies updated. Proper environment separation (dev, staging, prod). Secure secrets management.
    - **API9: Improper Inventory Management:**
      - **Mitigation:** Maintain clear documentation of API endpoints, versions, and supported MCP servers/tools. Versioning strategy for the MCP Client API itself.
    - **API10: Unsafe Consumption of APIs:**
      - **Mitigation:** This API is a consumer of external MCP server APIs. Connectors must handle responses securely, validate data, and manage errors from these external APIs correctly. Use HTTPS for all external calls.
- [ ] **Define Logging and Monitoring for Security Events.**
  - **Details:**
    - **Events to Log:**
      - Authentication successes and failures (for the MCP Client API).
      - Authorization failures (if/when implemented).
      - Significant configuration changes (especially security-related).
      - Errors related to credential fetching or usage by connectors.
      - Rate limit exceeded events.
      - Circuit breaker state changes.
      - Any detected input validation failures that suggest malicious intent.
      - Errors from MCP servers that might indicate security issues (e.g., 401/403 from an MCP server).
    - **Log Content:** Include timestamp, source IP (of AI agent), user/agent identifier, event type, outcome, and relevant non-sensitive details.
    - **Secure Log Storage:** Ensure logs are stored securely with appropriate access controls and retention policies.
    - **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical security events (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, critical errors from security components).
    - **Regular Review:** Periodically review security logs and alerts.
- [ ] **Address Data Privacy and Compliance Considerations.**
  - **Details:**
    - **Data in Transit:** All communication (AI to API, API to MCP Servers) must use HTTPS/TLS.
    - **Data at Rest:**
      - Configuration data containing secret references should be stored securely.
      - If caching MCP server responses, ensure sensitive data in the cache is protected and TTLs are appropriate.
    - **Sensitive Data Handling:** Be mindful of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive business data that might pass through the API via `tool_input` or `tool_output`.
      - Log sanitization: Avoid logging sensitive data elements from requests/responses unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.
      - Connectors should be designed to request and return only the necessary data from MCP servers.
    - **Compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA):** If the AI or the data it processes falls under such regulations, ensure the API's handling of data (especially in logs, caches, and error messages) is compliant. This might involve data minimization, anonymization, or specific consent mechanisms (though consent is likely handled by the AI agent's system).
    - **Transparency:** Ensure the AI agent (and its users) are aware of which MCP servers are being interacted with.

## Phase 3: Implementation

### 3.1. Environment Setup & Core API Structure

- [ ] **Set up the Next.js project structure for the API endpoint.**

### 3.2. Configuration Management Implementation

- [ ] **Design and implement the `ConfigurationManager` component.**
  - **Details:**
    - This component will be responsible for loading, parsing, and providing access to MCP server configurations.

    - Implement schema validation for the loaded configurations (using `zod` based on Phase 2.1 schema).
- [ ] **Implement secure retrieval of secrets for MCP server authentication.**
  - **Details:**
    - If using a secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.):
      - Integrate the necessary SDK/client for the chosen secrets manager.
      - The `ConfigurationManager` or individual connectors will use this to fetch actual secrets based on references in the configuration (e.g., `JIRA_CLIENT_ID_VAULT_KEY`).
    - If using environment variables directly for secrets (local development): Ensure they are loaded correctly and accessible.

### 3.3. MCP Server Connector Framework

- [ ] **Define the `MCPServerConnector` abstract class or interface.**
  - **Details:**
    - Based on Phase 2.2 (MCP Server Abstraction Layer).

    - Define common properties or getters for configuration, logger.
- [ ] **Implement the Request Router/Dispatcher component.**
  - **Details:**
    - This component will take a `server_id` from the request.
    - It will use the `ConfigurationManager` to get the configuration for that `server_id`.
    - Based on the `type` field in the configuration (e.g., "jira", "slack"), it will instantiate and return the correct `MCPServerConnector` implementation.

      - Map generic `tool_input` to server-specific API parameters.
      - Map server-specific API responses to generic `tool_output` format.
    - [ ] **Implement basic error handling and mapping to standard API error codes.**
      - Catch errors from the server's API (network errors, 4xx, 5xx).
      - Map them to the error codes defined in Phase 2.1 (e.g., `MCP_CONNECTION_ERROR`, `MCP_SERVER_ERROR`).
    - [ ] **Integrate with the logging system.**

### 3.5. Error Handling and Retry/Circuit Breaker Implementation

- [ ] **Implement the full error handling strategy as defined in Phase 2.1.**
  - **Details:**
    - Ensure all error responses from the API adhere to the standardized JSON structure.
    - Implement the defined error codes.
    - Ensure proper sanitization of error messages propagated from MCP servers.
- [ ] **Implement global retry mechanism for connectors.**
  - **Details:**
    - Use a library (e.g., `async-retry`) or implement a utility for retrying failed requests to MCP servers.
    - Make it configurable (max attempts, backoff strategy) via global settings and per-server overrides (as per Phase 2.1).
- [ ] **Implement circuit breaker pattern for connectors.**
  - **Details:**
    - Use a library (e.g., `opossum`) or implement a basic circuit breaker.
    - Wrap calls to MCP servers within the circuit breaker logic.
    - Configure thresholds (failure rate, timeout) and reset period.

### 3.6. Unit and Integration Testing Setup

- [ ] **Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest).**
- [ ] **Write unit tests for key components:**
  - **Details:**

    - `RequestRouter` (correct connector instantiation).
    - Individual `MCPServerConnector` methods (mocking external API calls) for data transformation and logic.
    - Input validation logic.
    - Error handling utilities.
- [ ] **Write initial integration tests for the API endpoint.**
  - **Details:**

## Phase 4: Testing & QA

### 4.1. Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Define a comprehensive testing strategy covering:**
  - Unit tests for individual functions and methods.
  - Integration tests for API endpoints and MCP server interactions.
  - End-to-end tests simulating real AI agent behavior.
  - Performance testing (load testing, stress testing).
