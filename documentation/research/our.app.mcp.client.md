# MCP Client Integration Research

## Executive Summary

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a universal protocol for connecting AI models and applications to a wide range of tools and data sources via standardized servers. Building an MCP client enables our app to interact with multiple MCP servers (e.g., Slack, Jira, WebSearch) in a modular, scalable, and vendor-agnostic way.

## What is an MCP Client?

An MCP client acts as a bridge between our application (or LLM agent) and one or more MCP servers. It manages connections, routes requests, and aggregates responses from different servers, each exposing a set of tools (APIs, actions, or data sources).

## Why Integrate Multiple MCP Servers?

- **Unified access:** Centralize access to Slack, Jira, WebSearch, and other tools via a single protocol.
- **Modularity:** Add or remove integrations by updating configuration, not core logic.
- **Vendor-agnostic:** Avoid lock-in and enable switching or combining tools easily.
- **Real-time and batch:** Support both real-time (chat, notifications) and batch (search, analytics) use cases.

## MCP Client Architecture

1. **Server Registry:** Configuration file/object listing all MCP servers (name, version, entry path, tools).
2. **Connection Manager:** Handles connection lifecycle (connect, handshake, exchange, terminate) for each server.
3. **Transport Layer:** Communicates with servers (e.g., via stdio, HTTP, WebSocket).
4. **Request Router:** Forwards app/agent requests to the appropriate MCP server/tool.
5. **REST API/SDK:** Exposes endpoints or functions for the frontend or LLM agent to use MCP tools.

## Integration Steps

1. **Define server registry:** List all MCP servers (Slack, Jira, WebSearch, etc.) with their config.
2. **Initialize connections:** For each server, establish a connection using the appropriate transport (e.g., StdioClientTransport for local servers, HTTP for remote).
3. **Expose unified API:** Provide REST endpoints or SDK functions that route requests to the correct MCP server/tool.
4. **Handle responses:** Aggregate and normalize responses for the frontend or agent.
5. **Add new servers:** Update the registry and re-initializeâ€”no core code changes needed.

## Example Use Cases

- **Slack:** Send/read messages, list channels, trigger workflows via MCP tools.
- **Jira:** Create/read issues, update tickets, fetch project data.
- **WebSearch:** Query external search engines and return results to the app or agent.

## Best Practices

- Use a configuration-driven approach for server registry and tool definitions.
- Isolate transport logic for each server type (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket).
- Implement error handling and reconnection logic for robust operation.
- Secure sensitive credentials and API keys (use .env files or secret managers).
- Log all requests and responses for traceability and debugging.

## Next Steps

1. Design the server registry for our app (list all required MCP servers).
2. Implement or adapt an MCP client (TypeScript or Python) with modular server support.
3. Expose REST or SDK endpoints for the frontend/agent to use MCP tools.
4. Test with Slack, Jira, and WebSearch servers; expand as needed.
