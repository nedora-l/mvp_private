# Plan to add new features to our Nextjs App

## Overview

We have a working application, the next step is to add new features and pages to the application. While respecting the current structure of the app and the design.

## Task Status Legend

- [ ] To Do
- [x] Completed
- [⏳] In Progress
- [!] Blocked

## AI Agent Context Management

To maintain context and ensure effective collaboration with AI assistants throughout this project, we'll implement the following strategies:

### Memory Architecture

We'll use a multi-layered memory approach to maintain context:

1. **Session Memory**: Captures immediate context during development sessions
2. **Task Memory**: Maintains summaries of completed work and decisions made
3. **Project Knowledge Base**: Stores semantic understanding of code structures and patterns

### Smart Prompt Templates

When working with AI on specific tasks, use these standardized prompt structures:

#### Implementation Prompt Template
```
I need to implement [feature] for our password manager page.

Context:
- Current progress: [task status]
- Related files: [file paths]
- Design patterns: [patterns to follow]

Requirements:
- [Specific functionality needed]
- [Security considerations]
- [UI/UX requirements]

Please help me with: [specific assistance needed]
```

#### Review Prompt Template
```
Please review my implementation of [feature/component] for the password manager.

Context:
- Files changed: [file paths]
- Implementation approach: [brief description]
- Specific concerns: [any areas needing extra attention]

Evaluation criteria:
- [Security standards]
- [Performance considerations]
- [Code quality metrics]
```

### Context Persistence

To maintain continuity across development sessions:

1. **Task Checkpoints**: Each task will include a "Last State" section that captures progress
2. **Decision Log**: Important architectural or security decisions will be documented
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Insights from AI interactions will be captured in task documentation

### Task Progress Tracking with Context

Tasks will include additional metadata to support continuity:

```
Task: [Task Name]
Status: [Status]
Progress: [Percentage]
Last Session Summary: [Brief recap of last work session]
Key Decisions: [Important choices made]
Next Steps: [Clear direction for continuation]
Context References: [Related files, docs, or discussions]
```

## AI Context Management Plan for Password Manager Project

To maximize AI assistance throughout this project, we'll implement the following context management approach:

### 1. Project Context Repository

- [x] Create a `todos_manager/context/password_manager/` directory to store project context
  - [x] `architecture.md`: Overview of the password manager architecture
  - [x] `security_model.md`: Documentation of encryption approach and security considerations
  - [x] `component_map.md`: Relationship between components
  - [x] `progress_log.md`: Ongoing development journal
  - [ ] `data_models.md`: Define data models for password storage

### 2. Task-Specific Context Files

- [ ] For each major feature, create a context file with:
  - [ ] Requirements and acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Design decisions and rationale
  - [ ] Implementation challenges and solutions
  - [ ] Testing approach and results

### 3. AI Interaction Workflow

- [ ] Define standard AI interaction patterns:
  - [ ] **Research prompts**: For gathering information on best practices
  - [ ] **Design prompts**: For creating component and data structures
  - [ ] **Implementation prompts**: For coding assistance
  - [ ] **Review prompts**: For code review and improvement
  - [ ] **Testing prompts**: For identifying test cases and approaches

### 4. Context Refreshing Strategy

- [ ] Implement techniques to maintain context across sessions:
  - [ ] Start each session with a summary of previous work
  - [ ] Reference specific context files for detailed history
  - [ ] Use task checkpoints to track progress
  - [ ] Document insights and decisions for future reference
